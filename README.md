## 📂 Projects
Advanced Job Shop Scheduling for Energy Efficiency Optimization and Industrial Robot Integration.
• Applied the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method with the given dataset and predefined constraints using IBM CPLEX Studio 
for problem formulation. Optimized energy usage and delivery times with minimum tardiness by achieving a 20% cycle time reduction for 
job shop robot scheduling
Cyber Truck Controller Bent Pins Issue Analysis.
• Diagnosed the vehicle’s functional safety issues, like a complete electronic shutdown due to the dislocation of the controller pins.
• Collaborated with the design team for pin tolerance change of the TPA connector harness and the NPI team for the post-revision trials and 
approvals, along with revised QAN handling instructions, including pre- and post-torque quality checks. Failure rate improvement from 20% 
to 6% with proposed potential scrap rework strategies.
Camera Pitch Calibration
• Analyzed disengagement issues of front-end camera position due to the top beauty cover pressure suppression, resulting in blurred object 
image resolution with a Cpk of approx.1.35 and a Cp less than 1 for factory vs. field camera pitch adjustments with USL and LSL specs for an 
SD of 0.7. Induced IFTTT logic for NC generation and redesigned the new camera bracket to stabilize space adjustment during calibration
